# DSC510 - Week 11 and Week 12
This week, we're doing some work on the code we've been messing around with throughout the semester. Here, you'll be taking the dataset you selected last week and using your existing tools on them. 

As a result, you will be: 
1. Processing the .csv
1. Making a dictionary of your data.
1. Processing the data and correcting its parameters. 
1. Generating a report of the `top 10` of whatever that data is representing. What that markdown report provides is up to you. 

_The above will force you to reconsider your .py files a little._

### A word of warning
Some of you wrote a `.md` file last week as opposed to generating one with python. If you did this, I let you slide as I was excited that you at least knew how to do that. For `Week 11`, this will not be the case. Generate your report file using the `make_report.py` file. Not doing this will result in a grade of 0 for the final project. 

### This is due by the end of the day on the 17th of November (This is a Saturday!)

## What `specifically` is the assignment this week?

1. Evaluate and process your dataset using the avenger class. 
1. Generate a markdown report using a metric of your choice (based on the data you downloaded)
1. Upload your working code to the Github Repository into your folder on Week 12 by Saturday, November 17.
1. Help other students out by commenting on their code or correcting their code (do this 3 times in the next 2 weeks).
