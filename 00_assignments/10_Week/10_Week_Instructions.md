# DSC510 - Week 10
## Getting Started with the Final Countdown
This week, you are going to be finding another data source and performing the activities you've done to the avengers dataset. 

You will go to the same place the 538 dataset came from: [The 538 Repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)

From here, you will search for a dataset that you'd like to create a dictionary out of. Over the next couple of weeks, you will be adjusting, augmenting, and zipping up that dataset so that as you leave here, you'll have 2 folders for your github portfolio with data that you can analyze later.

Each week, you'll be responsible for *something* and what that is is broken down below: 

| Week 	| General Task                               	| Parameters                                                      	| Deliverable                                    	|
|------	|--------------------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------	|
| 10   	| Find a Dataset                             	| Must be from 538 and roughly the same structure as the avengers 	| A CSV                                          	|
| 11   	| Get the Data in Order                      	| Header, dictionary, and various aspects of the dictionary       	| Use the existing MSDS510 project to process it 	|
| 12   	| Recreate Week 9's Assignment for your Data 	| Get a markdown report out                                       	| A Markdown Report                              	|
