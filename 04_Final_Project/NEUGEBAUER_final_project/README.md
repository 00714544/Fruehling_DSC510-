This project is for the final MSDS510 project.

## Part One
This part is simply to setup the project by:
1. Finding a data set within fivethirtyeight
2. Creating a project and put the data in it
3. Build code to read the raw csv and convert it to UTF8

For this assignment, I opted to skip the command line and am using
YAML so I can use an external plain-text config file.

I'm using the bad drivers data.
