This project is for the final MSDS510 project.

## Part One
This part is simply to setup the project by:
1. Finding a data set within fivethirtyeight
2. Creating a project and put the data in it
3. Build code to read the raw csv and convert it to UTF8

For this assignment, I opted to skip the command line and am using
YAML so I can use an external plain-text config file.

I'm using the bad drivers data.

## Part Two
This week is about processing the CSV for bad driver.

1. Processing the .csv
2. Making a dictionary of your data.
3. Processing the data and correcting its parameters.
4. Generating a report of the top 10 of whatever that data is representing. What that markdown report provides is up to you.

The constructs from the midterm will be used, but modified for the
bad driver data set.
