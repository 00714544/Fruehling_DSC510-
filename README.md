# DSC510 - Week 9
## Getting started with Markdown
This week, we're going to talk about writing a program to make a report. Once we get our code up to snuff, we're going to upload it to our repository AND then, we will work on creating a program that will.

1. Generate a report using your previous work.
2. Generate a report in markdown that you can send elsewhere. 

---
The sort of learning path we'll expect from you this week is straight forward (I hope).

1. You will learn about Markdown.
2. Then you will read about generating Markdown with Python.
3. Then you will apply those things to a starter script.

### What is Markdown?

[First Python Notebook: Hello Markdown](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/markdown/)

### How can I do stuff with Markdown using Python?.

Well, quite simply you can trick it by manually adding this stuff to your print statements. For example, after the midterm, you would have been asked to continue creating the class object *avenger*. 

### The Starter Script.

Note: the chapters 26-29 were required reading for this week. They are not required reading but they will be useful for you to look through to make this thing work!

There is a file inside of the repository LALONE_MSDS510. It is the *avenger* class that we would have created ourselves had we had another semester to build it. Instead of building it all, it is missing some of the end of the Markdown Statement. In essence, I have given you a scaffold upon which you will build more content. Your job is to use all your resources to get it finished. 

There is also a file in MSDS_LALONE called, "Make Report." It is also missing a few items. Namely, how do you connect the avenger class to the file. Additionally, what does each line of this code even do? 

## What is the assignment this week?

1. Finish the avenger class generation for Markdown. 
2. Import the Avenger class so that the report can work.
3. Upload it to the Github Repository by this Thursday.
4. Help other students out by commenting on their code or correcting their code.
